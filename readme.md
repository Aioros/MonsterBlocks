# Monster Blocks

An NPC sheet for FoundryVTT designed to faithfully reproduce the apperance of D&D 5e monster statblocks.

Currently does not support rolls or editing, ideal for users who need a creature reference during a game, but don't intend to use Foundry for rolls. Rolls and editability are planned for the future.
