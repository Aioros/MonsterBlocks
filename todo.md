## Back Burner
- Editing (for version 2)
- Rolls for saves/skills that aren't listed (not proficient) <sup>One can simply roll an ability check</sup>
- Some creatures have "sub features" like breath weapns, the bodies of these are indented. <sup>unsure if this is possible to do correctly</sup>
- Differentiate which cantrips belong to what casting feature. <sup>unsure how possible</sup>
- Unique target types should be formatted as so: <sup>This is not currently supported by the system.</sup>
	> Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., **one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained.** Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.
