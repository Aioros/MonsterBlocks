	> Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., **one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained.** Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.
